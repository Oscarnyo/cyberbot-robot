# Cyberbot Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for a Cyberbot project using the BBC micro:bit, focusing on robotic movements and sensor interactions.

## Features
- **Advanced Movement Control**: The code enables precise control of the Cyberbot's movements. This includes forward and backward motion, turning, and speed modulation. These functions demonstrate the robot's agility and responsiveness to commands.
- **Sensor Utilization and Environmental Interaction**: The project leverages the micro:bit's built-in sensors to enable the Cyberbot to interact with its environment. This can include obstacle detection, light or sound-based responses, and other sensor-driven behaviors, showcasing the Cyberbot's ability to autonomously navigate and react to external stimuli.
- **Customizable Behaviors**: The Python script provides a foundation for custom behavior programming. Users can modify or extend the code to create unique movement patterns or responses, allowing for a personalized robotic experience.
- **Educational Aspect**: The project serves as an excellent educational tool for understanding basic robotics, sensor integration, and programming principles. It is especially suited for beginners and those interested in exploring the fundamentals of robotic control and sensor use.

## Robot Demonstration
Watch the Cyberbot in action in this [demonstration video](https://uowmalaysia-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/0204819_student_uow_edu_my/EYGMfbeKgt9Bvt0SdCG4MQgBPEh9UI99DiRlBEQcGuZlNg?e=hBwAzR). This video showcases the robot's capabilities, including its movement control, sensor responses, and custom behaviors.
